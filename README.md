# What the matrix is
A 3D world engine, with semantic textures applied to meshes, lights and sounds.

If an AI is connected to a text-world, capable of showing plausible cause-consequence chains, the percepts we feed it with would be like textual descriptions floating dynamically in a 3D space. For visual and audio senses, a typical 3d game engine, running headless, could provide the space-time skeleton on which "semantic textures", made of qualitative/quantitive descriptions (potentially expressed in a subset of a natural language), could be applied to form this world.

A constructed language like [Elefen](https://elefen.org/) is a good candidate for textures. It has a completely regular grammar but still feels natural. It can be made formal through [Gellish](https://www.gellish.net/). For the 3D scenes, [OpenDDL](http://openddl.org/) and [OpenGEX](http://opengex.org/) are good candidates. They are clean and generic.
